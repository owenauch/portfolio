## Free Food Finder -- [Site](http://free-food-finder.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/) + [Code](https://github.com/owenauch/Class-Assignments/tree/master/CSE%20330%20(Rapid%20Prototype%20Development%20and%20Creative%20Programming)/Free%20Food%20Finder%20MERN%20App)
For our final project in CSE 330 at Wash U, we decided to tackle an age-old college problem: finding free food on campus. We built a web app that allowed students to post events on campus that offered free food, and then displayed these events in a live map of campus showing all the events with free food. My partner for this project was [Visaal Ambalam](https://github.com/visaals).

For the back-end, we used NodeJS with Express to build an API and saved event data in a MongoDB database. For the front-end, we used ReactJS as our framework, as well as LeafletJS for the map and Bootstrap to style the site.
